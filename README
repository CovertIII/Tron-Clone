TrailBlazer
===============
This is a Tron clone game.  It is a multiplayer game meant to be played
over a LAN (but not over the internet).  Drive your "cycle" around while
 trying to avoid the trails made by yourself and other players. 

Install
=======
Right now the game is built for Mac OS X v10.6.  If you
have that you should be able to run the binaries with no
problem.  If not, you have to build it from source. The game
uses GLUT, enet, tpl, OpenAL, Ogg, and Vorbis libraries.  Find them and install
them.  After that, if you on a Mac, just run the 'make' command and it should 
work.  If on a linux machine change the flags in the makefile to the correct flags.
I have them there already you just have to rename the macro.  On windows 
look into MinGW to compile it. 

Here's where to find the libraries:
 o GLUT - http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/ 
   Comes on a Mac, no need to download.  On linux use a
   pakage manager to find it.
 o OpenAL - http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/default.aspx
   Comes on the mac -- no need to download.  
 o enet - http://enet.bespin.org/
   "...a relatively thin, simple and robust network communication layer 
   on top of UDP (User Datagram Protocol)." This takes care of networking
   for me.
 o tpl - http://tpl.sourceforge.net/
   "Tpl is a library for serializing C data." I use this to pack up
   data before I send it out with enet.
 o Ogg Vorbis - http://xiph.org/downloads/
   Download libogg and libvorbis.  Use these to decode the sound files
   so OpenAL can play them.

Gameplay
========
There are three binaries: tron, tserver, and tclient.  

tron: This is a two player game on the same machine.  Fist player uses
	the arrow keys to move and the second uses the 'w', 'a', 's', 'd' 
	keys to move. 

tserver: This starts a tron server where many people can play
	the tron game over a LAN.

tclient:  This is the client to play against different people connected 
	the tserver.  When it start you must enter in the name or IP address
	of the server.  If you want to host a game you must start the tserver
	progam first, then type localhost or 127.0.0.1 to connect to
	your server.  If other people want to play they must type the IP
	address of your computer on your network.

	Push 'n' to change you name.  Push 't' to send a message.

	Once connected push the space bar to indicate you are ready.  While 
	playing use the arrow keys to move yourself around.  Up and down make
	you go faster and slower.  'a' will make you power slide and 's' will 
	toggle your trail on or off.

Misc.
=====
The sound files were taken from BZflag, SuperTuxKart, and Apple's OpenAL
test sample project.  If you don't like those sounds, then find sounds you
 do like convert them into a Ogg Vorbis file rename them to the ones in
the sound_data folder.
