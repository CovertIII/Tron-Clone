Tron Game
========
This is going to be a tron clone.  Before this game, I had just
learned about memory managment with C.  I made this game to practice
using memory managment and a little bit of absract data type.  I
plan on to have it networked.  So in the future there will be a
server and client.  Right now I am still working on the game logic.
Mess around with this if you would like to.  It is not really 
playable now.

There are three executables made by the project: tron, tserver, 
tclient.  tron is a program to test the game; it is a two player 
game, but you will have to share the same keyboard to play.  The 
server, tserver, is a server to host a multiplayer game played over
a LAN.  tclient is the client.  The multiplayer aspect isn't done yet.
