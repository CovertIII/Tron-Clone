In general, the compiler option -lNAME will attempt to link object files with a library file ‘libNAME.a’ in the standard library directories. Additional directories can specified with command-line options and environment variables, to be discussed shortly. A large program will typically use many -l options to link libraries such as the math library, graphics libraries and networking libraries.
